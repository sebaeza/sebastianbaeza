I am an Associate Professor of Geography at the Universidad de Concepción and a dedicated researcher exploring the intersection of Economic Geography, Innovation Systems, and Regional Development. My work primarily investigates how peripheral regions navigate technological change and global production networks, with a particular focus on the Global South and East Asia.
