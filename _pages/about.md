I am an Associate Professor of Geography at the [Universidad de Concepción](https://www.udec.cl) and a researcher exploring the intersection of Economic Geography, Innovation Systems, and Regional Development. My work investigates how peripheral regions navigate technological change and global production networks, with particular focus on the Global South and East Asia.

My research spans two interconnected domains: the geographies of knowledge and innovation in natural resource industries—particularly salmon aquaculture—and the cultural economy of creative industries, notably video game development. Through these lenses, I examine how policy design can foster transformative innovation and sustainable development in regions traditionally positioned at the margins of the global economy.

I hold a PhD in Human Geography from [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk), an MSc in Governance of Risks and Resources from [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de), and a degree in Geography from the [Pontifical Catholic University of Chile](https://www.uc.cl). I have also held research positions at [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp), where I continue active collaborations on the evolutionary economic geography of Japanese innovation systems.

I am currently the Principal Investigator of a FONDECYT Iniciación project (2025–2028) examining transformative innovations in Chilean salmon aquaculture and their potential to address grand societal challenges.
